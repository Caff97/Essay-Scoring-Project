    "This project explores model building and validation in machine learning, focusing on key concepts such as supervised vs. unsupervised learning, the distinction between labels and features, and the differences between binary and multiclass classification. Our project will use a dataset that consists of student essays scored from 1 to 6, alongside various features such as word count and punctuation usage.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Our goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting essay scores for unseen data. We will experiment with classification algorithms, including Naive Bayes and Random Forest, and evaluate their performance using the Quadratic Weighted Kappa score. A crucial aspect of this study is feature selection, as identifying the most relevant features can significantly enhance model accuracy. Additionally, we will employ cross-validation techniques to improve model robustness and generalisability. To gain deeper insights into our model’s performance, we will visualise results using confusion matrices. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate effective techniques for handling data in machine learning while refining predictive models for automated essay scoring. The first thing to do is to import the libraries that will be required for this project."

This approach \"teaches\" the model to identify patterns or relationships between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. The goal of supervised learning is to enable the model to learn from these examples so that it can accurately predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

    "Data labeling is the process of annotating data with meaningful tags or labels that provide context, allowing machine learning models to recognise patterns and make accurate predictions. This involves categorising or tagging various types of data - such as images, text, audio, or video - with relevant labels that describe their content or characteristics. By systematically labeling data, machine learning algorithms can learn from these annotations to improve model accuracy, identify trends, and enhance decision-making across a range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics."

    "The training dataset is a large sample of data used to train a machine learning model, allowing the algorithm to learn and build an effective model. The test dataset, typically a smaller portion, is used to evaluate the model's performance in an unbiased manner after it has been fully trained. The evaluation process involves calculating a measurable metric, often referred to as accuracy. The test dataset should only be used once the model has been trained with the training and/or validation datasets, ensuring that the evaluation reflects the model’s ability to generalise to unseen data."

Given this redundancy, we will remove the \"chars\" column from our feature DataFrame, as both variables convey essentially the same information. This is particularly important for methods like Naive Bayes, which assume feature independence - an assumption that would be violated if both were included. We will see more on this later. We do not believe that there are any other highly correlated features, so we will only be removing \"chars\". "

    "There are two primary types of classification tasks in machine learning: binary classification and multi-class classification. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In binary classification, the dataset is divided into exactly two distinct classes. The goal of the binary classifier is to categorise the data into one of these two classes. This is commonly used in scenarios where there are only two possible outcomes. Examples of binary classification tasks include predicting whether a patient has a certain disease, categorised as \"positive\" or \"negative\". Other typical examples could include \"Yes\" vs \"No\" or \"True\" vs \"False\". <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "On the other hand, multi-class classification involves categorising the dataset into more than two classes, meaning that there are multiple possible labels. In multi-class classification, the goal is to assign each instance to one of several classes. This type of classification is used in more complex scenarios where the data falls into one of multiple categories. For example, classifying images of animals into different species or breeds, such as distinguishing between \"dog\", \"cat\", or \"bird\". Another example could be classifying types of fruit, where the categories might include \"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", and so on. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In summary, binary classification deals with two possible outcomes, while multi-class classification deals with multiple outcomes, allowing for more complex categorisation tasks. In this project, since the essays are scored on a scale from 1 to 6, we will be performing multi-class classification. This means that the model will be trained to predict one of six possible scores for each essay, where the score represents the quality of the essay as classified into one of the six distinct categories. The goal is to build a model capable of accurately predicting which score an essay should receive based on its features."

    "Before applying multi-class Naive Bayes (NB) classification, we need to normalise our data. The StandardScaler() function is used to scale the feature columns so that each column has a mean of 0, a variance of 1, and is normally distributed. This is important because Naive Bayes classifiers assume that each feature is independent and follows a normal distribution. By using StandardScaler(), we ensure that the data is standardised, which helps improve the performance of the classifier. <br>\n",

This method aligns well with the assumptions of the Naive Bayes classifier. We may also use log scaling if the data is highly skewed, to prevent issues like underflow or numerical instability during calculations."

By applying the same scaling parameters (mean and standard deviation) to the test data as used for the training data, we maintain consistency. <br>\n",
    "Additionally, for discrete data, like categorical variables or class labels, scaling is not typically necessary. Scaling only applies to continuous numerical features, where the magnitude of the values can affect the model’s behaviour. Discrete data, such as class labels or binary features, is not sensitive to scaling because their values are distinct and don't rely on their scale to convey information. Hence, we don't scale test data features separately to avoid introducing inconsistencies."

    "The Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' Theorem, which calculates probabilities to predict the likelihood of different classes given the features of the data. The core idea behind the Naive Bayes classifier is to compute the probability of each class, conditioned on the features, and choose the class with the highest probability. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a simple yet effective probabilistic classifier that works well with a relatively small number of parameters, making it computationally efficient and faster compared to other classification algorithms. It is called \"naive\" because it makes a strong assumption that the features used for prediction are independent of each other, meaning the presence of one feature does not affect the presence of another. This assumption simplifies the model, even though in reality, some features might be correlated. Despite this, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well, particularly in high-dimensional datasets and applications like spam filtering and text classification. <br>\n",

    "The Quadratic Weighted Kappa is a statistical measure used to assess the degree of agreement between two raters who assign scores to items on an ordinal scale. Its values range from -1 to 1, where -1 signifies complete disagreement, 0 indicates no better agreement than what would be expected by chance, and 1 represents perfect agreement. <br>\n",
    "QWK is an extension of Cohen’s Kappa, which measures inter-rater reliability for categorical variables. However, unlike Cohen’s Kappa, QWK accounts for the ordinal nature of the categories. This means that it not only evaluates whether the raters agree but also considers the severity of disagreements. Discrepancies between ratings are weighted based on their distance, with larger differences being penalised more heavily than smaller ones. For instance, misclassifying an essay score of 6 as a 1 would be considered a more significant error than misclassifying it as a 5, and the QWK metric reflects this by assigning greater penalties to larger misclassifications. <br>\n",
    "Because of its sensitivity to the ordinal structure of the data, QWK is particularly useful in fields such as automated essay scoring. By emphasizing the extent of disagreement rather than treating all disagreements equally, QWK provides a more nuanced and fair assessment of classification performance."

    "It is important to note that the QWK score varies each time we train a new model. This variation occurs because the dataset is randomly split into training and test sets in each iteration. As a result, different subsets of data are used for training, leading to slight variations in model performance. To obtain a more reliable estimate of the model’s effectiveness, we could consider averaging the QWK score over multiple runs or using techniques like cross-validation to reduce variability."

    "Random forests is a machine learning method used for classification, regression, and other tasks. This technique builds a collection of decision trees during training, each trained on a random subset of the data. By combining the outputs of multiple trees, the model improves accuracy and reduces the risk of overfitting compared to individual decision trees. <br>\n",
    "In classification tasks, each decision tree in the forest votes for a class, and the final prediction is determined by majority vote. <br>\n",
    "For regression tasks, the output is typically the average of the predictions from all trees. <br>\n",
    "One assumption for the RF classifier is that we are under supervised learning, meaning it require labeled data to train the model. The key advantage of this approach is that it leverages the power of multiple weak learners to produce a more robust and generalisable model. By randomly selecting subsets of data and features for each tree, random forests introduce diversity, reducing variance and improving overall model stability. <br>\n",
    "This classifier method is widely used in various applications, including automated essay scoring, due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and maintain strong predictive performance."

    "Upon analysis, the RF model appears to produce predictions similar to those of the Gaussian NB model. We still observe a tendency for misclassification, particularly with adjacent scores, indicating that the model struggles to precisely distinguish between closely related score levels. This suggests that while the RF approach may offer some improvements in overall prediction stability, additional feature selection will be necessary to enhance accuracy."

    "By direct comparison of accuracy scores, we can conclude that the RF model provides higher accuracy in predicting essay scores based on the given features. The RF approach, which combines multiple decision trees, allows for more robust and reliable predictions compared to the Gaussian NB model. However, while random forests improve overall accuracy, some challenges remain, particularly in differentiating between adjacent scores."

    "Furthermore, a comparison of the confusion matrices reveals that both models exhibit similar prediction patterns. However, the RF model demonstrates a slight improvement, with fewer extreme misclassifications. This means that it makes fewer predictions that are significantly far from the true score. While this indicates that the RF model captures the underlying patterns in the data more effectively than the Gaussian NB model, there is still room for improvement in refining score differentiation, particularly for adjacent categories. Further optimisation, and feature selection will enhance the model’s performance even further."

    "In this project, we explored machine learning techniques for automated essay scoring, focusing on model building, feature selection, and validation. By leveraging a dataset of student essays with various features, we trained and evaluated classification models to predict essay scores. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Among the models tested, the Random Forest classifier demonstrated superior performance compared to the Gaussian Naive Bayes model. This result highlights the effectiveness of ensemble learning in handling feature-rich datasets. The Random Forest model achieved a higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa score, indicating better agreement with human-rated scores. Furthermore, feature selection played a critical role in improving model accuracy, emphasising the importance of identifying the most relevant attributes for prediction, however this is one point of the project that needs refinement. Cross-validation techniques ensured that our model was robust and generalisable to unseen data. Visualisations in the form of confusion matrices, provided valuable insights into classification performance and areas for improvement. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in automating essay scoring while underscoring the need for careful model selection and validation. Future work could explore additional feature engineering techniques, deep learning approaches, or hybrid models to further enhance predictive accuracy."
